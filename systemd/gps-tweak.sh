# The EASYâ„¢ is embedded assist system for quick positioning, the GPS engine
# will calculate and predict automatically the single ephemeris (Max. up to 3
# days) when power on, and save the predict information into the memory, GPS
# engine will use these information for positioning if no enough information
# from satellites, so the function will be helpful for positioning and TTFF
# improvement under indoor or urban condition, the Backup power (VBACKUP) is
# necessary.
